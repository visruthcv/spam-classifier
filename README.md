# SpamClassifier

This is a SMS Spam Classifier which will tell you whether a message is Spam or Not. It is a Machine Learning Based App which is based on SMS Spam Collection Dataset from Kaggle. 
The Goal of the app is to predict whether a message is Spam or Not. 
The ML model used here is a Naive Bayes model. The web App is being built using Flask and deployed to Heroku. The dataset is also provided in this repo along with the model's code (model.py). Feel Free to download and tweet things.
